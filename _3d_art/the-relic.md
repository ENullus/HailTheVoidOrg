artist: Erebus Nullus
description: At some point you realize that we're in  a constant state of remembering. Take this ancient artifact for example. Do you remember it? It was the symbol human made to correlate the connection between their gut and their brain. Both parts have a core all human should listen to. Only following one has led us down some dark paths.
