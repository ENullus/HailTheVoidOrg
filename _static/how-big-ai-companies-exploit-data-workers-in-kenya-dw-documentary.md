title: How big AI companies exploit data workers in Kenya | DW Documentary
description: "Behind today's AI revolution stands an invisible workforce: millions of data workers who painstakingly train artificial intelligence systems we all use.

These workers are breaking their silence, challenging the system, and demanding fair recognition in the world of AI."
